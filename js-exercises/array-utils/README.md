# Instructions

Write your own version of 
- `forEach`
- `map`
- `filter`
- `reduce`

You can read the [ECMAScript Spec](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html) to see the semantics of these functions.

Write test cases also. Try to make them as close to actual ones as possible.

**You are NOT allowed to use existing array utilities.**
